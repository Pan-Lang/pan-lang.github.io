## Project Motivation
One of our team members currently volunteers at the Mckinley Foundation Food Pantry at the Garden Hills Elementary. He noticed that there were communication barriers between the pantry coordinator and the non-english speaking people. Our team decided to tackle this problem by creating a webapp and helping the food pantry coordinator with direct translations of stock items and common phrases/questions for multiple languages, while also keeping track of the stock of the food items.

## Tech Stack

  - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
